        <p>Education</p>
        <p>2021 - Present  Ngee Ann Polytechnic (NP)</p>
        <p>At 17 years old, I am currently in the Common Infocomm Tech Programme course. As NP and Singapore Poly were the closest to my house compared to the other Polys, my choice was either of these 2. Most of my friends came to NP along with the fact that i had heard that NP is better in ICT compared to SP is why I chose to come to NP.</p>
        <p>2017 - 2020 Hillgrove Secondary School (HGSS)</p>
        <p>After Primary School, I scored well enough to enter the express course but not good enough for any prestigeous school. From 13-16, I entered HGSS. I entered the school with a slightly negative state of mind as I had heard of their undisciplined behaviour and I was not into aeroplanes either. The only upside was that some of my friends also came to this school. But with my low PSLE score, this was about the best i could hope for. My impression was changed when i actually went there for classes. They were not disciplined but it was just like any other school, nothing extra bad. I even made amazing friends along the way. Definitely the most fun part of my life so far.</p>
        <p>2011 - 2016 St. Anthonys's Primary School (SAPS)</p>
        <p>From 7-12, I entered a Primary school. The Primary School I entered was SAPS, a Christian school. However, I am not a Christian, I am actually Buddhist, it was just close to my house at the time of my enrollment. I really enjoyed my time there, especially in my last two years before graduation so, of course, I was pretty sad to depart from this school and my friends.</p>
        <p>2008 - 2010 Nursery and Kindergarden</p>
        <p>When i was 4-6 years of age, my parents put me into Nursery and Kindergarden. I don't remember too much besides that I was very scared of others and upon meeting other kids, I hid behind my mother. It was a good experience I guess.</p>
