                <h3>Project 1</h3>
                <p>Afew months ago, I used my Python programming knowledge and spent 3 weeks to program an entire game in the IDLE. 
                    The game played out like so: You are the Mayor of Simp City and your city consisted of a 4x4 board which you can 
                    build on every turn. There are five buildings and 8 copies of each. 2 buildings are selected randomly every turn 
                    and you select one of them to build. The game's objective was to score as high as possible. Each building scores 
                    differently depending on where they are built like for example, Beach is 3 points when on the right or left side of
                    the map but only 1 point otherwise. The house gains a point for each different building adjacent to it but if there
                    is a factory adjacent to it, it only scores 1 point no matter what. </p>

                <h3>Project 2</h3>
                <p>Last year, I used my knowledge of website development to create a website for Apple as a way to test myself on my
                    knowledge of web development. I spent a month on it. It was a personal project I did for myself. The website was designed 
                    in my own way and was completed all by myself. </p>
