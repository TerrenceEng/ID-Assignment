PROJECT NAME

This project is to make a personal portfolio website for myself. This website gives you a little look at what I am capable of doing and why you should hire me. The website gives employeers a small introduction on who I am through my homepage and other pages telling them about my education history and my past projects that i have done for myself which should show them that I am proficient in website development and 2 programming languages, Python and C#.

DESIGN PROCESS

This website is made for employers looking for someone who has skills in programing or web development to employ during this covid phase. This project should allow them to achieve that by checking if I am qualified, from my education in the IT course in Ngee Ann as well as from my personal projects that i have done, provided with evidence by my images.

The wireframes which i did to think of my layout is labelled "ID_S10223166_Terrence Eng Yew Kang_Assg1_wireframe" folder and contains a wireframe for every page of the website.
